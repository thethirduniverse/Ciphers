To solve a vignere cipher, the most important thing is to determing a period. Both index of coincidence and kasiski's method can serve as a way to calculate the period, but they are not necessarily accurate. The solveVignere.py program iterates over a given range of periods, and prints out the best deciphering it can provide given each individual period. And then the user can look at the output to determine which period is the real index.
